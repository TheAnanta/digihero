# DigiHero - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

DigiHero is a comprehensive gamified Flutter application designed to teach digital literacy skills to children and young people. The game is inspired by Google's "Be Internet Awesome" program and uses engaging gameplay mechanics to teach essential online safety and digital citizenship skills.

## Architecture

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Feature-Based Structure**: The app is organized by features rather than by file type
2. **Provider Pattern**: Used for state management across the application
3. **Service Layer**: Separate services handle game logic, audio, and progress tracking
4. **Model-Driven**: Strong typing with comprehensive data models
